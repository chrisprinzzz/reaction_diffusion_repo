# reaction_diffusion_repo
Grey Scott reaction-diffusion algorithms for 2d pt grids and existing meshes imported from Grasshopper 

Instructions:
1. Open .gh file in Rhino Grasshopper and write the convolution.json 
2. Run .py file
3. Read results.json and apply deformation to existing mesh in Grasshopper
